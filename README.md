This is my repo for learning Pytorch from [Pytorch Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html). I have gone through a Medium post, [Understanding PyTorch with an example: a step-by-step tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-pytorch-with-an-example-a-step-by-step-tutorial-81fc5f8c4e8e), previously. To be able to apply Pytorch, I believe it requires multiple times fo learning and from different resources. Every time I find something newly understood. It's like memorizing English vocabulary. My vocabulary/knowledge of Pytorch and Deep Learning is extended every time I learn it.
